# ShopRite - Load All To Card

## Introduction

This is a Chrome extension that adds a "Load All To Card" button to the
ShopRite [Digital Coupon
Center](http://coupons.shoprite.com/). The Javascript action on this
button will click on all the coupons in one shot, adding all of them to the
card.

## Installation

git clone this repository to your local disk or download the zip file and extract.

Go to the Chrome extensions page (chrome://extensions). You'll need to enable
developer mode in order to load an unpacked extension.

Click on "Load unpacked extension" and navigate to the folder in which you
cloned or extracted the source files. Select this folder to load the extension.

## Usage

Once you've installed and enabled this extension, go to the ShopRite Digital
Coupon Center and find the "Load All To Card" button just above the "Digital
Coupon Center" heading. Click on it and it'll load all the coupons to your
card.

Note: this button works only on the current page of coupons. If you want to get
all the coupons at once, click on "Show All" first before clicking the "Load
All To Card" button.
